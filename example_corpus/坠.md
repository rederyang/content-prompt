# Raw Content

An Oscar-winning courtroom thriller, *Anatomy of a Fall*—directed by French filmmaker **Justine Triet**—captured the 2024 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The accolade instantly propelled this French-language drama onto must-watch lists worldwide, but the film’s real power lies in how it turns a single, mysterious death into a rigorous study of truth, language, and family loyalty.

The plot begins with Samuel, a novelist, found dead after plunging from the attic window of his remote Alpine chalet. Suspicion lands on his German wife, Sandra, who faces trial for homicide. Their eleven-year-old son, Daniel, blind since childhood, is the only possible witness. As the court probes the family’s private life, everyday quarrels are recast as evidence of murderous intent, and the audience is invited to weigh fragments that never quite lock into a complete picture.

Triet structures the trial like a linguistic chess match. Sandra testifies in fluent—yet second-language—French, sometimes slipping into English or German when emotions spike. Each code-switch sparks debate over what she “really” meant, illustrating how translation can tilt the scales of justice. Cross-examinations dissect not just actions but word choice, accent, and even the pitch of an argument recorded on Sandra’s laptop. For English learners, this courtroom serves as a vivid lesson in pragmatics: the same sentence can sound aggressive, neutral, or apologetic depending on context and language.

Meanwhile Daniel’s testimony raises a moral dilemma familiar to many teenagers: should he defend his mother out of love, or pursue an objective truth that might condemn her? His struggle underscores the film’s central theme—intimacy does not guarantee understanding.

The story happens in winter, in a house high in the mountains. One day, a man named Samuel is found dead in the snow. No one knows what really happened. Did he fall by accident? Did he kill himself? Or did someone push him?

The police think his wife, Sandra, might be responsible. So she goes to court. In the trial, both sides show different kinds of evidence, like a phone call, broken glasses, and a recording of the couple fighting. Their son, Daniel, is the only witness. He is 11 years old and blind, so he couldn’t see what happened. But he remembers hearing strange sounds.

**Anatomy of a Fall: Parsing Truth on a Mountain Precipice**

**《坠落的审判》- 一场雪崖罗生门**

*Anatomy of a Fall* won the 2024 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. It is a serious and emotional movie by French director Justine Triet. The film looks at a difficult marriage, how people use language, and how hard it is to know the full truth.

The story starts in a quiet house in the French Alps. A writer named Samuel is found dead in the snow under a window. At first, people thought it’s an accident. But soon, they wonder: Did he fall? Did he kill himself? Or did his wife, Sandra, push him?

During the court trial, their private life is shown in detail. The prosecutors say Sandra may have become angry after years of jealousy. They play a recording of their last big argument, show some blood on the stairs, and check Samuel’s last emails. But the evidence is not clear. The fight sounds normal, the blood might be from before, and the emails prove nothing.

Sandra’s lawyers say the police cannot prove she pushed him. There are no fingerprints, and the blood does not show a clear story. A note on Samuel’s laptop shows he may have been thinking about suicide. Even the dog’s barking, which the police saw as important, is called just normal house noise.

The strongest moment comes from their 11-year-old son, Daniel, who is blind. He remembers two loud noises and running steps before silence. What he says might save his mother or cause her to be blamed. Everyone listens carefully as he tries to remember.

At the end, the film does not give a clear answer. The truth is left open. The movie shows us that in real life, the truth is often not simple and sometimes we only see small parts of it.

## Level 4 (350 words)

*Anatomy of a Fall*, winner of the 2024 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, is a gripping and thought-provoking film by French director Justine Triet. It delicately unpacks the complexities of marriage, the nuances of language, and the unsettling nature of doubt. The story begins in a secluded chalet perched in the French Alps, where Samuel, a novelist, is discovered dead beneath an attic window. What appears to be a tragic accident quickly evolves into a national sensation. Did Samuel slip and fall? Did he take his own life? Or was he deliberately pushed by his wife, Sandra?

As the courtroom proceedings unfold, the couple’s private world is meticulously dissected. Prosecutors construct a narrative of long-standing creative rivalry and emotional strain, suggesting that jealousy may have escalated into violence. They play a recording of a bitter argument, point to minute traces of blood on a stair railing, and enlist digital experts to examine Samuel’s final emails. Yet none of the evidence is definitive. The argument could reflect typical marital discord, the blood may have resulted from an earlier injury, and the emails offer no irrefutable clues.

Sandra’s defense team focuses on what remains unproven. There are no fingerprints indicating a physical altercation, and the trajectory of the blood droplets does not substantiate the theory of a shove. A half-written note on Samuel’s laptop hints at suicidal thoughts, casting the entire case in a different light. Even the family dog’s agitated barking—portrayed by the prosecution as a sign of violence—is reframed as background chaos in a noisy household.

The emotional core of the trial lies in the testimony of their 11-year-old son, Daniel, who is blind. He recalls hearing two loud thuds and hurried footsteps followed by silence. His statement could either vindicate his mother or lead to her condemnation. The courtroom listens in tense silence as he navigates the fog of memory, deep loyalty, and fear.

When the verdict is finally delivered, Triet refrains from offering a tidy conclusion. The film leaves audiences contemplating conflicting interpretations, underscoring that in reality, truth often emerges not in clarity, but in fragments that resist neat resolution.

gripping: interesting; holds your attention  
thought-provoking: makes you think deeply about something  
nuances: subtle differences or details  
evolves: develops slowly into something different  
meticulously: in a very careful and detailed way  
discord: disagreement or conflict  
substantiate: to provide evidence to prove something  
vindicate: to clear someone of blame or suspicion  
condemnation: strong disapproval; punishment or blame

## Level 5 (390 words)

Winner of the 2024 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, *Anatomy of a Fall* is French director Justine Triet’s razor-sharp and emotionally frigid excavation of marriage, language, and ambiguity. The film opens at a remote chalet teetering on the edge of the French Alps, where acclaimed novelist Samuel is discovered lifeless in the snow beneath an attic window. What begins as a routine inquiry into a tragic fall rapidly spirals into a national spectacle: was it a tragic accident, a calculated suicide, or a murder orchestrated by his wife, Sandra?

As the courtroom drama unfolds, the couple’s private life is laid bare with surgical precision. The prosecution constructs a narrative charged with creative rivalry and simmering resentment, suggesting that years of domestic and artistic tension erupted into deadly violence. They unveil a recording of the couple’s final, venom-laced argument, point to flecks of blood on a staircase railing, and bring in forensic experts to dissect Samuel’s final emails. But every piece of evidence is riddled with ambiguity. The argument, raw as it is, could stem from ordinary marital friction; the bloodstains might originate from an earlier injury; and the emails—while suggestive—fail to draw any clear conclusions.

Sandra’s defense dismantles the prosecution’s claims not with dramatic revelations, but by highlighting the absence of proof. There are no fingerprints to suggest a struggle, and the blood pattern offers no definitive support for the theory of a shove. A haunting, unfinished note found on Samuel’s laptop alludes to suicidal ideation, reframing the narrative without ever fully answering it. Even the dog’s frenzied barking—touted by prosecutors as a reaction to violence—is reframed as background noise in a chaotic household.

At the heart of the trial is Daniel, the couple’s eleven-year-old son, blind since early childhood. His recollection of two loud thuds and hurried footsteps before an eerie silence becomes the emotional centerpiece of the case. His testimony could either save his mother or destroy her, as he delicately navigates the tangled terrain of memory, love, and fear under the crushing weight of public scrutiny.

When the verdict finally arrives, Triet resists the temptation to offer clarity. There is no neat resolution, no triumphant exhale—just the unsettling hum of uncertainty. The audience exits the courtroom, much like the jury, haunted by the realization that truth often arrives fragmented, slippery, and just out of reach.

teetering: shaking and almost falling
