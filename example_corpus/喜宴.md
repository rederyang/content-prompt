## Level 4\.

Ang Lee’s *The Wedding Banquet* (1993) is a perceptive and emotionally resonant film about a Taiwanese man residing in the United States who conceals his sexual orientation in order to conform to his parents’ traditional expectations. Although he is in a committed relationship with another man, he consents to a fabricated marriage with a woman seeking a green card, believing this arrangement will appease his family and avoid confrontation.

What begins as a pragmatic solution soon escalates into a far more intricate dilemma when his unsuspecting parents take over the wedding preparations and orchestrate an elaborate traditional ceremony. The situation becomes even more precarious when the woman unexpectedly becomes pregnant, thrilling the parents while leaving his true partner feeling alienated and betrayed.

Instead of trivializing the subject matter, the film employs humor as a vehicle to underscore the emotional dissonance between individual identity and cultural obligation, illuminating the inner conflict of someone navigating multiple, often incompatible, roles. By the conclusion, the parents intuit the truth but choose silence—a form of passive acceptance that allows them to preserve familial harmony without direct acknowledgment.

Acclaimed internationally and nominated for an Academy Award, *The Wedding Banquet* endures as a seminal work for its candid exploration of identity, familial pressure, and the unspoken compromises that sustain human relationships.

## Level 5\.

Ang Lee’s *The Wedding Banquet* (1993) operates as a nuanced meditation on diasporic identity, performative assimilation, and the psychosocial ramifications of familial expectation. The narrative centers on a Taiwanese immigrant who obfuscates his homosexuality to preserve filial decorum, orchestrating a spurious marriage with a woman seeking legal residency as a strategic subterfuge.

This ostensibly contained fabrication metastasizes when his unknowing parents impose ritualized structure upon the sham, transforming it into a hyperbolic affirmation of heteronormative tradition. The subsequent pregnancy—an unplanned rupture—further destabilizes the charade, heightening the protagonist’s bifurcated existence and rendering his true partner increasingly peripheral.

Rather than trivializing its thematic core, the film mobilizes irony and comedic displacement to excavate the dissonance between inherited sociocultural paradigms and self-determined identity. It deftly portrays the erosive effect of sustained duplicity, illuminating the affective toll exacted by the continuous negotiation of incompatible roles.

The parents’ eventual, unspoken recognition enacts a form of affective diplomacy—an ambiguous silence that at once obscures and condones—thereby preserving the integrity of familial structure without confronting its ideological fractures. As a seminal contribution to queer transnational cinema, *The Wedding Banquet* endures for its incisive engagement with the aesthetics of concealment, intergenerational dissonance, and the pathos of conditional acceptance.

Woo词

* **diasporic**: living away from your home country, often as part of a group.  
* **psychosocial**: about how people feel and how they relate to others.  
* **subterfuge**: a secret trick used to hide the truth or avoid trouble.  
* **metastasizes**: spreads quickly and becomes worse or harder to control.  
* **charade**: something fake that is made to look real; a pretend act.  
* **protagonist’s**: something that belongs to the main person in a story.  
* **diplomacy**: dealing with problems or people in a careful and respectful way.  
* **concealment**: the act of keeping something hidden or secret.
