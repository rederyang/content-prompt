    "content": "Ang Lee's The Wedding Banquet (1993) is a perceptive and emotionally resonant film about a Taiwanese man residing in the United States who conceals his sexual orientation in order to conform to his parents' traditional expectations. Although he is in a committed relationship with another man, he consents to a fabricated marriage with a woman seeking a green card, believing this arrangement will appease his family and avoid confrontation.\nWhat begins as a pragmatic solution soon escalates into a far more intricate dilemma when his unsuspecting parents take over the wedding preparations and orchestrate an elaborate traditional ceremony. The situation becomes even more precarious when the woman unexpectedly becomes pregnant, thrilling the parents while leaving his true partner feeling alienated and betrayed.\nInstead of trivializing the subject matter, the film employs humor as a vehicle to underscore the emotional dissonance between individual identity and cultural obligation, illuminating the inner conflict of someone navigating multiple, often incompatible, roles. By the conclusion, the parents intuit the truth but choose silence—a form of passive acceptance that allows them to preserve familial harmony without direct acknowledgment.\nAcclaimed internationally and nominated for an Academy Award, The Wedding Banquet endures as a seminal work for its candid exploration of identity, familial pressure, and the unspoken compromises that sustain human relationships.",

Input:
Genre: Movie
Topic: Anatomy of a Fall

Output:
{
    "title": "Truth in the Alpine Silence\n阿尔卑斯山的静寂中的真相————聊聊《坠落的审判》",
    "content": "Anatomy of a Fall, winner of the 2024 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, is a gripping and thought-provoking film by French director Justine Triet. It delicately unpacks the complexities of marriage, the nuances of language, and the unsettling nature of doubt. The story begins in a secluded chalet perched in the French Alps, where Samuel, a novelist, is discovered dead beneath an attic window. What appears to be a tragic accident quickly evolves into a national sensation. Did Samuel slip and fall? Did he take his own life? Or was he deliberately pushed by his wife, Sandra?\nAs the courtroom proceedings unfold, the couple's private world is meticulously dissected. Prosecutors construct a narrative of long-standing creative rivalry and emotional strain, suggesting that jealousy may have escalated into violence. They play a recording of a bitter argument, point to minute traces of blood on a stair railing, and enlist digital experts to examine Samuel's final emails. Yet none of the evidence is definitive. The argument could reflect typical marital discord, the blood may have resulted from an earlier injury, and the emails offer no irrefutable clues.\nSandra's defense team focuses on what remains unproven. There are no fingerprints indicating a physical altercation, and the trajectory of the blood droplets does not substantiate the theory of a shove. A half-written note on Samuel's laptop hints at suicidal thoughts, casting the entire case in a different light. Even the family dog's agitated barking—portrayed by the prosecution as a sign of violence—is reframed as background chaos in a noisy household.\nThe emotional core of the trial lies in the testimony of their 11-year-old son, Daniel, who is blind. He recalls hearing two loud thuds and hurried footsteps followed by silence. His statement could either vindicate his mother or lead to her condemnation. The courtroom listens in tense silence as he navigates the fog of memory, deep loyalty, and fear.\nWhen the verdict is finally delivered, Triet refrains from offering a tidy conclusion. The film leaves audiences contemplating conflicting interpretations, underscoring that in reality, truth often emerges not in clarity, but in fragments that resist neat resolution.",

### Example 3

Genre: Movie
Topic: Inception

Output:
{
    "title": "The Architecture of Dreams\n梦境的架构————聊聊《盗梦空间》",
    "content": "Have you ever questioned whether your current experience is real or just a dream? Christopher Nolan's film Inception invites us to explore this intriguing idea.\nIn the movie, Dom Cobb is a skilled \"extractor\" who enters people's dreams to steal secrets. His new mission, however, is to perform \"inception\": planting an idea into someone's subconscious so subtly that they believe it's their own. To achieve this, Cobb and his team delve into multiple layers of dreams, each one deeper and more unstable than the last.\nThis complex structure raises questions about the nature of reality. If our senses can be deceived in dreams, how can we be certain of what's real when we're awake? This concept echoes philosophical discussions, such as Descartes' skepticism about the reliability of our perceptions.\nThe film also touches on the idea of \"lucid dreaming,\" where individuals are aware they are dreaming and can sometimes control the dream. This blurs the line between dreams and reality even further.\nMoreover, Inception can be seen as a metaphor for filmmaking itself. Just as Cobb constructs dream worlds, directors create cinematic experiences that immerse audiences, making them question their perceptions. This parallel suggests that both dreams and films can influence our thoughts and emotions profoundly.\nAt the film's end, the spinning top—a tool Cobb uses to distinguish dreams from reality—continues to spin, leaving viewers uncertain about his state. This ambiguity reinforces the film's central theme: the elusive boundary between reality and illusion.\nInception challenges us to question the nature of our reality. If our minds can create vivid dreams that feel real, how can we be certain that our waking life isn't just another layer of illusion? By exploring the boundaries between dreams and reality, the film encourages us to reflect on our perceptions and the foundations of our beliefs. Perhaps, like Cobb, we all carry our own totems—symbols or truths we hold onto to distinguish what's real from what's not. But in a world where perceptions can be manipulated, can we ever be truly sure?",
