After this movie, she became very well-known around the world.\nThe story happens in winter, in a house high in the mountains. One day, a man named Samuel is found dead in the snow. No one knows what really happened. Did he fall by accident? Did he kill himself? Or did someone push him?\nThe police think his wife, Sandra, might be responsible. So she goes to court. In the trial, both sides show different kinds of evidence, like a phone call, broken glasses, and a recording of the couple fighting. Their son, Daniel, is the only witness. He is 11 years old and blind, so he couldn't see what happened. But he remembers hearing strange sounds.\nThe movie does not give a clear answer at the end.
