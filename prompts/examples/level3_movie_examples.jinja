Output:
{
    "title": "Parsing Truth on a Mountain Precipice\n雪崖罗生门————聊聊《坠落的审判》",
    "content": "Anatomy of a Fall won the 2024 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. It is a serious and emotional movie by French director Justine Triet. The film looks at a difficult marriage, how people use language, and how hard it is to know the full truth.\nThe story starts in a quiet house in the French Alps. A writer named Samuel is found dead in the snow under a window. At first, people thought it's an accident. But soon, they wonder: Did he fall? Did he kill himself? Or did his wife, Sandra, push him?\nDuring the court trial, their private life is shown in detail. The prosecutors say Sandra may have become angry after years of jealousy. They play a recording of their last big argument, show some blood on the stairs, and check Samuel's last emails. But the evidence is not clear. The fight sounds normal, the blood might be from before, and the emails prove nothing.\nSandra's lawyers say the police cannot prove she pushed him. There are no fingerprints, and the blood does not show a clear story. A note on Samuel's laptop shows he may have been thinking about suicide. Even the dog's barking, which the police saw as important, is called just normal house noise.\nThe strongest moment comes from their 11-year-old son, Daniel, who is blind. He remembers two loud noises and running steps before silence. What he says might save his mother or cause her to be blamed. Everyone listens carefully as he tries to remember.\nAt the end, the film does not give a clear answer. The truth is left open. The movie shows us that in real life, the truth is often not simple and sometimes we only see small parts of it.",

Topic: Inception

Output:

    "title": "Could This Be a Dream?\n聊聊《盗梦空间》",
    "content": "Have you ever wondered if this moment is part of a dream? Perhaps you're sleeping on a plane, listening to Edith Piaf's \"Non, je ne regrette rien,\" and these words are just part of your dream.\nIf this sounds familiar, you've probably seen Christopher Nolan's mind-bending film Inception.\nThe movie follows Cobb, a dream spy who can enter others' dreams to steal secrets. This time, however, he's asked to do something harder: plant an idea.\nTo make it work, the dream must feel completely real. So they go deeper—into a dream within a dream within a dream. Each level takes them further from reality.\nThe ending is famous and puzzling. Many still debate: was Cobb still in a dream?\nSometimes we wake up confused, unsure if we were dreaming or not. A dream may feel long and logical, but when we wake, it makes no sense.\nNolan uses this to show us: what we call \"reality\" is based on how our minds work.\nDreams are obviously made-up, but maybe our \"real world\" is just a more hidden dream.\nSo... are you dreaming now? Or are you sure you're awake?",
