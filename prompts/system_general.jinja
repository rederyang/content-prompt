- Select 5-10 relevant vocabulary words from the content.
- Each string in the list should be formatted as "Word: English Definition".
- Provide concise and clear English definitions for each word.
- The choice of words and the style of definitions should be implicitly guided by the provided examples.
- The vocabulary should be appropriate for general English learning, so avoid too many specialized or technical words.

        # ... 5-10 vocabulary items
